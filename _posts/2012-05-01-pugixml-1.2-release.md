title: pugixml 1.2 release
---

pugixml-1.2 is finally out. This is a major release with lots of new features and compatibility improvements (read the [changelog](http://pugixml.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-1.2/docs/manual/changes.html) for details).

Highlights for this release include:

* New optional header-only compilation mode that does not require compiling pugixml sources and can improve performance for certain applications due to inlining
* Enhanced interface for PCDATA manipulation using an xml_text object
* C++11 range-based for-loop support for node/attribute iteration
* Compatibility improvements for many mobile platforms (including Android, Windows Mobile and other SDKs/devices)

You can [download the source package](http://github.com/zeux/pugixml/releases/download/v1.2/pugixml-1.2.zip) or get the new version from Subversion using the latest tag (http://pugixml.googlecode.com/svn/tags/latest).
