title: pugixml 1.7 release
---

pugixml-1.7 is out. This is a major release that focuses on performance and memory improvements along with several bug fixes (read the [changelog](/docs/manual.html#v1.7) for details).

Highlights for this release include:

* Introduced a new [compact tree storage mode](http://pugixml.org/docs/manual.html#dom.memory.compact) that takes significantly less memory (2-5x smaller DOM) at some performance cost
* New integer parsing/formatting implementation (3-5x faster at getting/setting integers)
* Added `format_indent_attributes` that makes the resulting XML friendlier to line diff/merge tools
* Fix Clang 3.7 crashes in out-of-memory cases (C++ DR 1748)
