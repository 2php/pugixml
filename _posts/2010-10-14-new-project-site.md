title: New project site
---

pugixml now has a new home, [pugixml.org](http://pugixml.org). This site acts as a frontend for all pugixml-related stuff (downloads, documentation, support and other information). Additionally, there is a news feed, which you can subscribe to [via RSS](http://pugixml.org/feed.xml).

All downloads, documentation, Subversion repository and issue tracker are still hosted at Google Code; the existing links still work, and this is not going to change.
