title: pugixml 0.9 release
---

pugixml-0.9 is out. This is a major release with lots of fixes/improvements (read the changelog for the details). The most important changes are:

* Unicode support is completely reworked: now pugixml can be configured to use wchar_t instead of char for all string-based interfaces; also encoding conversion is performed during parsing/saving (with automatic encoding detection). All popular Unicode encodings are supported.
* New version features a new documentation, with detailed description of library interface and behavior, more samples, quick-start guide and so on.
* There are new functions for loading document from memory; they do not require the input buffer to be null-terminated. Old functions still work, but are deprecated and will be removed in the future version.

Also there are a lot of other changes, including performance and memory consumption improvements.
