pugixml-1.0 is out. This is a major release with lots of fixes/improvements (read the [changelog](http://pugixml.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release-1.0/docs/manual/changes.html) for details).

The most important changes are:

* XPath implementation was considerably improved â€“ variable support was added, exceptions and STL are no longer required for XPath to function, query evaluation performance was improved and several bugs were fixed.
* All deprecated functions and types were removed
* File loading/saving functions can now work with wide character paths
