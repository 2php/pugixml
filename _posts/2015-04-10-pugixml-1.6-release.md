title: pugixml 1.6 release
---

pugixml-1.5 is out. This is a maintenance release that fixes several bugs (read the [changelog](/docs/manual.html#v1.6) for details).

Highlights for this release include:

* Fixed translate and normalize-space XPath functions to no longer return internal NUL characters
* Fixed buffer overrun on malformed comments inside DOCTYPE sections
* Attribute/text values now use more digits when printing floating point numbers to guarantee round-tripping.

You can [download the source package](http://github.com/zeux/pugixml/releases/download/v1.6/pugixml-1.6.zip) or get the new version from GitHub using the latest tag (http://github.com/zeux/pugixml).
